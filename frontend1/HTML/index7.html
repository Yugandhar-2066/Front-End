      A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and
      are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do
      that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.

      Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may
      say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than
      five or six sentences. But a good paragraph should not be measured in
      characters, words, or sentences

      Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express
      the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence. Topic sentences are
      similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic
      sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point
      of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like
      the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a
      thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay
      is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph
      is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not
      all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing
      paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs,
      generally don’t have topic sentences.

        Our typology is built on three dimensions: internality, types of participants,
        and the degree of effective resistance. For our study, a civil war is any armed conflict
        that involves (a) military action internal to the metropole, (b) the active participation of the 
        national government, and (c) effective resistance by both sides. With these criteria, we differentiate 
        civil wars from other types of internal violent conflicts.
